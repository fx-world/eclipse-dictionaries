# Dictionaries for Eclipse IDE

These Eclipse-Features add dictionaries for the German language (Deutsch). If you are using Eclipse for Java development you have to use the version for JDT, but if you are developing in C++, you have to use the CDT version. In case you install the wrong version the full other development environment will be installed.

Based on the dictionary from [Free German Dictionary](https://sourceforge.net/projects/germandict/) from [Jan Schreiber](https://sourceforge.net/u/janschreiber/profile/).
